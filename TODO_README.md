# Next thing to work on in project:

1. Make posts only appear for the community they are tied too
  - I need to find the list rendering function in vue.js, so it pulls
    from the cur_community json page.
  - How do I edit it so it uses a link with a <std:community_id> which
    changes in the link

2. Add Delete Posts features

2. Up Vote And Down vote feature
  - Find images without transparent background
  - Resize Images Correctly (Or find smaller images)
  - Optimizations (Probably won't have time to change this)
    - currently is through views (this is really slow)
    - Use javascript so it doesn't have to reload the entire page
      - Once leaving it would update the vote attribute for the post
