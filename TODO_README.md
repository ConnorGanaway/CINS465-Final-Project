# Next thing to work on in project:

1. Add Delete Posts features (Not gonna worry to much)

2. Up Vote And Down vote feature
  - Find images without transparent background
  - Resize Images Correctly (Or find smaller images)
  - Optimizations (Probably won't have time to change this)
    - currently is through views (this is really slow)
    - Use javascript so it doesn't have to reload the entire page
      - Once leaving it would update the vote attribute for the post
