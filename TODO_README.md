# Next thing to work on in project:

1. Moderation Features
   - When a person creates a community they are added to the moderation json list
     - this is a list attribute for the community
   - Mods can update the about section (Community Profile Image if implemented?)
     - This will be in the top left for the nav bar in the menu
   - Delete any posts within the community
   - Invite Other users to become Moderators
   - Moderators will be listed on one of the side panels
   - Can timeout users
     - Do I use a dropdown bar or just input box with validation?
   - Can Ban users
     - When a user tries to access the page they are shown a "You are banned, can't
       access" message

2. Community Profile Image
   - add field to database
   - render as circle icons like the profile picture
   - placed to the left of the community name on the index page
   - placed to the left of the community name on the community page
   - Thumbnail
     - needed so size won't matter, and css won't mess up

3. Users can Delete their own posts(Not gonna worry to much)

4. Up Vote And Down vote feature bug
  - Current Number on screen doesn't refresh until cur_community json page is called
