# Next thing to work on in project:

1. Make posts only appear for the community they are tied too
  - I need to find the list rendering function in vue.js, so it pulls
    from the cur_community json page.
  - How do I edit it so it uses a link with a <std:community_id> which
    changes in the link

2. List the first X Communities on the home
  

3. Index Page
  - Replace Three box layout with search bar for Community Names
    - search foundation building blocks for a search bar
  - Repurpose footer box:
  - Create funny schmeddit logo for the website to be out on the footer
  - Add my name, year, class, and social links (With nice looking pictures)

4. Up Vote And Down vote feature
  - Find images without transparent background
  - Resize Images Correctly (Or find smaller images)
  - Optimizations (Probably won't have time to change this)
    - currently is through views (this is really slow)
    - Use javascript so it doesn't have to reload the entire page
      - Once leaving it would update the vote attribute for the post
