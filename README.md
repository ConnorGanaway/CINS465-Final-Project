# Next thing to work on in project:

- Make posts only appear for the community they are tied too
  - I need to find the list rendering function in vue.js, so it pulls
    from the cur_community json page.
  - How do I edit it so it uses a link with a <std:community_id> which
    changes in the link

- Community Form is not saving
  - Its identical to the suggestion and comment, form
  - I'll be done when I'm able to view the clickable link on the homepage
